/*
 * sh_seal_arena.h — Page-backed bump arena with one-way "seal" transition.
 *
 * Vendored shared utility (sh_* family alongside sh_arena, sh_json).
 * Single source of truth for the seal-arena primitive used by both
 * Hull (manifest, wasm host_symbols, CORS config) and Keel (router
 * + middleware tables via kl_router_freeze).
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *
 *   sh_seal_arena_init    — reserve N pages RW, ready to allocate
 *   sh_seal_arena_alloc   — bump-allocate a block (alignment-aware)
 *   sh_seal_arena_strdup  — copy a NUL-terminated string
 *   sh_seal_arena_memdup  — copy raw bytes
 *   sh_seal_arena_seal    — mprotect(RO); after this, alloc fails and
 *                            writes to allocated blocks fault
 *   sh_seal_arena_reset   — mprotect(RW), used=0.  Cycles the arena
 *                            back to the init state for re-use.  ONLY
 *                            for arenas with deliberately ephemeral
 *                            lifecycle (per-request, per-connection)
 *                            owned by a single code path.  Boot-time
 *                            policy arenas must NEVER reset.
 *   sh_seal_arena_destroy — munmap; safe on sealed/unsealed arenas
 *
 * Sealing is intentionally one-way per arena instance under normal
 * lifecycle (boot-time policy).  `_reset` exists as an opt-in escape
 * hatch for arenas whose purpose is to be cycled (Keel's per-request
 * sealed request snapshot is the canonical use case).  If you find
 * yourself reaching for `_reset` on a policy arena, you almost
 * certainly want a fresh `_init` instead.
 *
 * Threading: NOT thread-safe during the init→alloc→seal lifecycle.
 * That's a feature — these operations are by-design single-threaded
 * boot-time activity.  AFTER sealing, the OS read-only mapping is
 * trivially thread-safe to read from any number of threads.
 *
 * Portability: pure POSIX (mmap + mprotect + sysconf).  Cosmopolitan
 * provides the same calls via its libc shim, so APE builds work
 * unmodified.  No Windows path today; a future native MSVC port
 * would add a #ifdef _WIN32 branch using VirtualAlloc/VirtualProtect.
