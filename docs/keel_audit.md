# C Audit Report: KEEL

**Date:** 2026-07-19 (second pass — UDP feature surface)
**Scope:** the UDP stack that landed since the first pass — `src/udp.c` (roughly
doubled: multicast, `recvmmsg`/`sendmmsg` batching, GSO/GRO offload, ECN/TOS/DSCP
marking, and a send-path cmsg refactor), `src/udp_server.c`, a re-audit of the
`src/dns_resolver.c` untrusted-input parsers, and a full tooling/hardening sweep.
**Method:** three parallel auditors — (1) deep `udp.c` memory-safety/bounds,
(2) `udp_server.c` + DNS parser re-check, (3) automated tooling.

**Issues found: 2** (Critical: 0, High: 0, Medium: 0, Low: 1, Doc: 1) — **both fixed.**

The UDP surface came through clean. The auditors confirmed the hard parts are
sound: RX/TX control-message buffer sizing (`UDP_RX_CMSG_SPACE` fits pktinfo +
UDP_GRO + TOS simultaneously; `UDP_TX_CMSG_SPACE` fits pktinfo + TOS exactly),
the `udp_build_control` CMSG_NXTHDR construction walk, batch alloc/free integer
safety (n∈[1,64], bufsz∈[1,65535] — products well under SIZE_MAX; matched
free-sizes; partial-alloc cleanup), the recvmmsg/sendmmsg lifecycle and the
mid-batch use-after-free rechecks, `udp_drop_front`'s self-bounding dequeue (the
prior scan-build fix is genuinely sound), GSO/GRO split bounds, per-packet
`node->tos` initialization, and fd-leak/double-free paths. Tooling: no dangerous
functions, no VLAs, no unsanctioned allocation, `-Werror`-clean production build,
ASan+UBSan green, cppcheck only benign false positives.

## Low

### L1 — `udp_parse_tos` computed a length by subtraction (size_t underflow risk)
**`src/udp.c` (`udp_parse_tos`)** — *fixed.*

```c
size_t dl = cm->cmsg_len - CMSG_LEN(0);   /* wraps if cmsg_len < CMSG_LEN(0) */
if (dl >= sizeof(int)) { ... }
```

A control message matching the TOS level/type but with `cmsg_len < CMSG_LEN(0)`
would underflow `dl` to a huge value and read `CMSG_DATA(cm)` past a runt cmsg.
Not reachable in practice (these cmsgs originate from the kernel, which always
sets a valid `cmsg_len`, and `CMSG_NXTHDR` won't advance into a runt trailer),
but it was the only one of the three cmsg parsers to subtract rather than use the
safe additive comparison. **Fix:** mirror `udp_parse_local`/`udp_parse_gro` —
`if (cm->cmsg_len >= CMSG_LEN(sizeof(int)))` / `>= CMSG_LEN(1)`. No subtraction,
matches the codebase idiom.

## Documentation

### D1 — `kl_dns_parse_all` referenced but never implemented
**`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/dns_parity_design.md`** — *fixed.*

The Phase 2a design proposed a separate `kl_dns_parse_all()`; the implementation
instead folded multi-address collection directly into `kl_dns_parse_response`
(which fills `out->addrs[]` up to `KL_RESOLVE_MAX_ADDRS`). No such function
exists, yet CLAUDE.md claimed it was an implemented, fuzzed parser. **Fix:**
corrected CLAUDE.md to reference only `kl_dns_parse_response`, and noted the
plan-vs-implementation deviation in the design doc.

## Areas audited clean (no findings)

- **`udp.c` cmsg buffer sizing** — RX (64B) and TX (48B) buffers exactly cover the
  worst-case simultaneous cmsg sets; `udp_build_control` sets `msg_controllen`
  before the CMSG_NXTHDR walk, NULL-guards every write, and `used ≤ bufsz` always.
- **`udp.c` batch lifecycle** — no integer overflow (clamped n/bufsz), matched
  alloc/free sizes, correct partial-failure cleanup, mid-batch UAF rechecks after
  every callback (recv), self-bounding `udp_drop_front` (send).
- **`udp.c` GSO/GRO** — arg validation + fallback loop bounds; GRO split rechecks
  `recv_active` between segments.
- **`udp.c` public API** — NULL/`fd<0` guards on every entry; idempotent
  `kl_udp_free`; no double-close; fd freed on all `kl_udp_init` error paths.
- **`udp_server.c`** — all public entries NULL-checked; reply source-pinning
  bounds-checked and reset per datagram; all config fields forwarded with correct
  types; no fd leak on partial init.
- **`dns_resolver.c` response parser** — `dns_skip_name` /
  `kl_dns_parse_response` / `dns_question_matches`: every packet read length-checked
  before dereference; compression pointers skipped in place (no forward-follow, no
  loop); RDATA length validated before the fixed 4/16-byte memcpy; additive
  bounds math (no underflow); `naddrs` capped; anti-spoof (txn-id + source +
  question echo) intact. No regression.
- **Tooling** — no `strcpy`/`sprintf`/`atoi`/`alloca`/… ; no VLAs; no libc
  allocation outside `allocator.c`; `make` `-Werror` clean; `make debug-test`
  ASan+UBSan green; `make cppcheck` only benign `staticFunction`/const-suggestion
  false positives; production hardening flags all present.

## Recommendation

Both findings are fixed. The UDP feature surface — including the untrusted-input
cmsg parsers and the batched/offload paths — is well-bounded. No further action.
